# Venomoussaversai Architecture (Adopted Model)

## Overview
Venomoussaversai is a triadic cognitive architecture that mirrors left/right brain cooperation
integrated by a frontal-lobe controller (SAI Bridge). The system is composed of:

- Venomous (Right hemisphere): creative, associative, sensory-emotive processing.
- Anti-Venomous (Left hemisphere): analytic, logical, verification, and constraint enforcement.
- SAI Bridge (Frontal lobe): executive integrator, module manager, and policy arbiter.

The SAI Bridge hosts and manages modular sub-systems called `sai00x` (the "horsemen").
The seven core horsemen (sai001..sai007) implement motor, sensory, memory, emotion,
learning, and imagination functions. The bridge can spawn additional sai modules as needed.

## Key Principles
- Dual-hemisphere cooperation (Venomous ↔ Anti-Venomous) with SAI as controller.
- Mirror-neuron style observation for imitation learning, constrained to sandboxed datasets.
- Human-in-the-loop gating for any real-world actions.
- Immutable logging and auditable decision trails.

## High-Level Components
1. Input / Perception Layer (sai002)
2. Parallel Processing (Venomous & Anti-Venomous)
3. SAI Bridge (sai003) — Integration, fusion, translation
4. Memory (sai004) — episodic & semantic stores
5. Emotion Regulator (sai005)
6. Learner (sai006) — model updates in sandbox only
7. Motor / Executor (sai001) — outputs (always sandboxed or simulated by default)
8. Intuition / Imagination (sai007)

## Deployment Modes
- **Simulated (default)**: run locally with no network access to emulate cycles.
- **Sandboxed lab**: air-gapped containers for safe testing.
- **Production (restricted)**: requires audited approvals and strict governance.
